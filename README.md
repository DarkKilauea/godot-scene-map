## Installation

### Using the Asset Library

- Open the Godot editor.
- Navigate to the **AssetLib** tab at the top of the editor and search for
  "SceneMap".
- Install the
  [SceneMap](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/878)
  plugin. Keep all files inside the `/addons/scene_map/` directory checked during installation.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **SceneMap** plugin.

### Manual installation

Manual installation lets you use pre-release versions of this add-on by
following its `master` branch.

- Clone this Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarkKilauea/godot-scene-map.git
```

Alternatively, you can
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/DarkKilauea/godot-scene-map/archive/master.zip)
if you do not have Git installed.

- Move the `addons/` folder to your project folder.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **SceneMap** plugin.

## Usage

After installing the addon, use the create node dialog to add a `SceneMap` node to your scene.  SceneMaps require a ScenePalette to be created, which you can do from the `palette` property in the inspector while a SceneMap is selected.  Usage is similar to `GridMap`.
